           In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users (<span className="emphasis">“Statistical Information”</span>). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information does not indicate individuals’ identities, nor customers’ identities, and we will not link Statistical Information to any Personal Information. We may share Statistical Information with our partners, pursuant to commercial terms that we determine in our sole discretion. In addition, we may provide any information to third parties, so long as we have removed any information that identifies any particular individual or user, such as a name, address or contact information. We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about the use of the Solution. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Solution, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Solution. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Solution, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Solution. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Solution is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use located at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html and the Google Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
