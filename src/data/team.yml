    bio: Courtney joined Jennifer Garrison’s lab at the Buck Institute as a postdoctoral research fellow in 2022 to understand how the brain regulates feeding behaviors on different timescales. Courtney received her bachelor's degree in biopsychology from UC Santa Barbara in 2015 and her PhD from USC in 2022.\n\nAt Amaranth, Courtney leads the undergraduate fellows program in association with AFAR, now called the Time Initiative. Through this initiative, she catalyzes students' interest in aging biology, fosters community, and connects them to the resources they need to make a meaningful difference in the field.

  - name: Raiany Romanni
    title: Consultant, Policy and Ethics
    image: raiainy-romani.jpg
    bio: Raiany spends most of her time thinking about how converging technologies will transform governments and human nature in the coming decades. She's particularly interested in why secular humans narrate aging as a net-positive, teleological phenomenon—and in the negative effects of this narrative on economies and societies.\n\nHer work has appeared in The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Forbes, Quillette, The Hill, and ABC, and she is currently a Consultant for the Healthspan XPRIZE. With support from Amaranth, Raiany is working on a non-fiction book aimed at shifting the ethics, policy and philosophy of aging research. Alongside the Federation of American Scientists, she is also developing new policy narratives for aging, building on the bipartisan support for multi-billion-dollar governmental plans to democratize effective care and therapies for older adults as a foundation for common ground and progress in the aging field.

  - name: Martin Borsch Jensen
    title: CSO, Gordian
    image: martin-borsch-jensen.jpg
    bio: Martin is the CSO of Gordian Biotechnology, which develops pooled in vivo therapeutic screening to find effective therapies against underserved diseases of aging. He is also the president of the Norn Group, a non-profit supporting projects to accelerate aging research, including Impetus Grants and the Longevity Apprenticeship.\n\nPrior to his current role, Martin was a K99 Fellow in the Jasper Lab at the Buck Institute, where he conducted research on a range of cellular mechanisms involved in aging, such as mitochondrial function, NAD metabolism, DNA damage signaling, and stress responses. Martin received his PhD in Biogerontology from the National Institute of Aging and University of Copenhagen in Vilhelm Bohr’s lab.
