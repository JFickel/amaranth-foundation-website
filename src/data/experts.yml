  - title: Dr. Aaron Cravens
    bio: Dr. Cravens (Phd, Stanford) co-founded Revel Pharmaceuticals in 2019 inspired by the potential impact anti-AGE therapeutics could have on patients. He leads development of the team and technology that will take anti-AGE therapeutics into the clinic. Before Revel, Aaron worked at Google X and consulted for Bay Area biotech companies, where he developed operational and leadership experience. He previously founded a startup in the skincare space and trained in Stanfordâ€™s IGNITE Business School Program.

  - title: Prof. Claudio Hetz
    bio: Claudio Hetz attained his PhD in Biomedical Sciences at Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Switzerland, where he contributed to the role of ER stress in Prion-related disorders. He completed postdoctoral training at Harvard University to study stress responses at the level of proteostasis control and its relation to disease. He is currently a professor at the Buck Institute for Research in Aging in California. He also holds a visiting professor position at Harvard, the Director of the Biomedical Neuroscience Institute (BNI), and an associate investigator at the Center for Geroscience, Brain health and Metabolism (GERO).

  - title: Prof. Vincent Monnier
    bio: Vincent Monnier obtained his medical degree and diploma in Chemistry from the University of Basel, Switzerland. He did postdoctoral research on the advanced Maillard reaction in vivo at Rockefeller University. In 1982, he joined the Institute of Pathology where he did his residency in Clinical Pathology. His research focuses on the structure and significance of protein modification by advanced Maillard reaction and oxidation products in aging and age-related diseases, including diabetes, cataract and end stage renal disease.

    bio: Postdoc in Prof. Ewald's lab.

  - title: Dr. Martin Borch Jensen
    bio: Dr. Jensen focuses on developing technologies to interrogate the full network of aging processes inside living organisms. This includes multiplexed measurement of complex states, interpretable perturbations, and context-aware data models. Previously, he was an academic working on a range of cellular mechanisms involved in aging, including mitochondrial function, NAD metabolism, DNA damage signaling and other stress responses. Today, he is the CEO of Gordian.
