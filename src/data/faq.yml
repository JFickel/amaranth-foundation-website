  - question: How is Amaranth Prize connected to the Research Portfolio?
    answer: Research Portfolio is creating a new funding model for scientists, journalists, historians, and anyone else adding to our collective search for the truth, with the goal to augment existing approaches. They build tools for researchers to mint and trade tokens representing their research output. Their technology makes it much easier to create a prize or challenge, because they make it trivial to distribute to a large group of researchers through their research output.
